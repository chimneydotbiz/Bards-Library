By default, your "songbook" will be located here:
	C:\Users\pey10\AppData\Roaming\Vintagestory\abc
If you get to your Vintagestory folder and the "abc" folder is not there, simply create one yourself and name it "abc".

Now that you have located the folder, you are ready to move .abc files to it and start playing. It's as simple as that, really. You can create folders within the \abc folder to further organize your songbook.
