# Bards-Library

Contained within this here repository will be a large selection of music from various genres which has been accumulated for public distribution, organized by style of music. 

Each song which I have personally converted to .abc format has been broken down into multiple stems for various band sizes and levels of complexity in the arrangement. For each song, you should be able to play with only one person on a melodic instrument of some kind (anything but a drum kit). For most songs, the addition of a drum kit is possible. For many songs, a full ensemble performance is possible. These can range in band size from 3 to up to 6 or 7 instruments, each playing unique parts. 

The stem arrangements break down as such:
-Solo: These are full arrangements which can be played on one melodic instrument. The guitar, harp, piano, and hammered dulcimer are ideal for these parts.
-Drums: These are percussion elements which will greatly enhance whatever song they are added to. You can ONLY play these parts with a drum kit. Any other instrument will sound like garbled hogpiss.
-Vox: These are parts best performed by a vocalist, usually the lead line of any given arrangement. A microphone will be required to sing it, but it can also be substituted for a clarinet or saxophone.
-Harp: These are the parts which are best performed by the harp, usually reserved for bass parts and various plucky string elements. The harp has a really nice, clear bass sound and is a good 3rd instrument to have in an ensemble, after Melody and Drums.
-Various Instruments: Tracks which are labeled with specific instruments such as Guitar, Violin, Trumpet, etc. are stem tracks which will likely sound incomplete without the other accompanying tracks. While it is possible to substitute them with different instruments, it will generally sound best if you use the corresponding instrument with each track!
